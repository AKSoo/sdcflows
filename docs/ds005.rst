ds005
=====

``fmriprep``'s ds005 pipeline is used on datasets for which there are only t1ws and at least one functional (EPI) file.
Use the `--workflow-type ds005` or allow ``fmriprep`` to automatically determine the approriate workflow.

Stuff about t1w_preprocessing

EPI_HMC
~~~~~~

Stuff about EPI_HMC (also, why doesn't the graphviz img show any inputs to EPI_HMC?

EPIMeanNormalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..graphviz:: EPIMeanNormalization.dot

The EPIMeanNormalization sub-workflow uses FSL FLIRT with the BBR cost function to find the transform that maps the EPI space into the T1-space

EPIMNITransformation
